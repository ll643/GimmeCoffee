# Introduction
For our final project we are going to create a quantitative cost estimation model and provide qualitative economic information about available floc/clarification/porous media filtration systems. We will create both an overall construction cost model as well as a operation and maintenance cost model. Through research from online resources as well as from real-time water treatment plant performance data we will identify the advantages and disadvantages of the AguaClara treatment scheme relative to the other available technologies from an economic standpoint. After being taught to "question everything", we developed a curiosity about the effectiveness of current water treatment plants and whether or not AguaClara is currently implementing the best methods available given cost factors. We have also noticed a lack of documented information in regard to current treatment methods and their prices. Therefore we hypothesize that many plants across the globe are using methods that are standard but not necessarily the most cost effective method. By creating a simplified method of estimating construction/operating cost through python models with design constraints we hope to provide an accessible method of comparison that can make the treatment process more effective. Once this is achieved, it will be cheaper to implement filtration processes, and more people will be able to have access to clean drinking water.

# Project Proposal
For our project, we will first proceed by gathering qualitative information about the alternatives we have chosen from online resources and from the AguaClara Textbook. In order to do this efficiently, each of us has randomly selected one step of the process to research. From this we will get an overall understanding of pros and cons of each system which will allow us to figure out what variables we can manipulate and how this will affect the overall cost of the system. Afterwards, we will be contacting various treatment plants that are using different treatment systems for their performance data. Example of plants that we have plan to contact are the Ithaca Water Treatment Plant (mechanical flocculator, plate settlers, and membrane filtration as well as the Cornell Treatment Plant (mechanical flocculator, horizontal flow sedimentation, and sand filtration). From there we will create a python model from the equations provided from [Preliminary Cost Estimation Models for Construction, Operation, and Maintenance of Water Treatment Plants, 2013](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000155). We will test the accuracy of this model by using the plant data given we have obtained as well as using data from AguaClara plants.

# Design Parameters

**Key Parameters**
- Construction Costs  
- Operational Costs
- Capital Cost
  - Net Velocities are a rough alternative to capital costs
- Effectiveness (correlates with cost efficiency)
  - EPA standards require that drinking water turbidity not go over 0.3 NTU

For this project we will be using American EPA drinking water standards even though we recognize the fact that drinking water standards vary from location to location around the globe.

# Conclusion
Using the equations generated from the [Preliminary Cost Estimation Models for Construction, Operation, and Maintenance of Water Treatment Plants Report](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29IS.1943-555X.0000155), we were able to create four cost models in Python to estimate the construction and operation/maintenance costs of a water treatment plant: two of these models are "simple" and the other two are "complex" so that there is a simple and a complex model for both construction cost estimation and operation/maintenance cost estimation. The simple models require manual inputs of the variables which must have units and there is no way to negate a variable or to check if the input is within the bounds of the equation. The equations in the cost itself has units so if the input variable does not have the correct units the code will crash which is not the most elegant way to prevent input errors but it acts as safety blanket. In comparison, the complex models allow the user to negate terms which are not relevant to their plant and it checks to make sure that the inputs are within the ranges set by the report. If the input is not in this range the code will print a statement telling the user that their input is out of range. Again, like the simple model, the user must input constants with the correct units. In order to test the accuracy of our models, we ran them with constants given to us by the Ithaca Water Treatment Plant. Unfortunately, we could not find all of the plant design parameters that we needed for the model from the operating data which was sent to us so we had to estimate for the missing variables. We knew for certain that the flow rate of the Ithaca Treatment Plant is 2.4 MGD on a range from 1 to 200 MGD for our model so we calculated the percentage of the Ithaca Flow Rate on the range and used that percentage to calculate for the remaining missing variables. The construction and operating costs which were generated by the models were smaller than the actual costs. This can be attributed to the fact that we had to estimate more than half of the plant design parameters and in addition we did not include all of the equations which are included in the original report. Our low costs mean that we negated certain attributes of a water treatment plant used in the Ithaca Treatment Plant. There are more than 50 equations provided in the original report which this model was based off of, and due to time constraints it was not feasible for us to include all of these equations. However, the framework of each model is set so that it would very simple to add more variables and equations which would be a future avenue for this project.

# Comments and Suggestions
As mentioned in the Conclusion, there is a lot of work which can be done if this project is to be furthered. Most of this work would be coding work to make the Class function we created more elegant and user friendly. Other than adding more equations, one can also work on code which would assign units to the inputs and/or autocorrect the units of the inputs. In addition, there is a possibility of creating an Excel extension for this project. Users could input their plant design parameters onto an Excel sheet if they do not have any Python background and the code could pull the numbers from the Excel sheet and input them into the models. However, regardless, we are proud of the model which we have managed to create and through the process of creating this model we all definitely strengthened our Python coding abilities. We hope to see this project grow into something more sophisticated that AguaClara can implement in the near future!
